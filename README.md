# CryptoBot
A simple bot used for pump and dump events, that was a way for me to get introduced to python.
Works using the binance api.

I'm still encoutering some bugs,since the binance api is not the easiest to work with, and a lot of different variables come into play while buying different coins, so improvements are still to be made.
